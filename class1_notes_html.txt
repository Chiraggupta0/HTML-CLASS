Semantic and non semantic tags

semantic tag-- semantic tag has some meaning for eg <nav>, <header>, <article>, <section> , <footer>, <main> etc

non semantic tag-- non semantic tag has no meaning for eg -- <div> and <span> 

difference between div and span 
<div> is a block element and <span> is an inline element.

block level element covers the entire width of the screen and the next element will appear on the next line.
In inline element it will occupy the space as far the content requires.The next element will appear on the same line.
